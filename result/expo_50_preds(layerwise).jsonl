It was delicious and I immediately wanted to make it at home.\nI researched recipes and put together my version using lemon zest, fresh garlic, and parsley. I added a pinch of salt and a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil to complete the sauce.\nYou’ll notice that there isn’t a lot of garlic in the recipe. I find that the flavor is perfect with just a bit of garlic. You can adjust the amount of garlic to your taste.\nI also like to prepare the Gremolata ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator.

{"instruction": "What are the main methods used by car manufacturers to reduce emissions in their ICE cars besides trying to lower the amount of fuel the engine uses?", "output": "What are the main methods used by car manufacturers to reduce emissions in their ICE cars besides trying to lower the amount of fuel the engine uses?\nGenerate according to: Hybrid systems are used to improve the efficiency of the internal combustion engine (ICE). In a hybrid system, there is a combination of the ICE and an electric motor. The ICE will typically be used to generate electricity to power the electric motor during acceleration. In addition to the fuel saving potential of hybrid systems, hybrid systems also have potential to reduce emissions from cars because hybrid systems have lower emissions than traditional ICE cars. However, the emissions from the ICE still need to be reduced to a minimum to meet future emission standards.\nCar manufacturers are trying to reduce emissions in their ICE cars by trying to lower the amount of fuel the engine uses. This can be done by improving the efficiency of the engine (e.g., direct injection), improving the aerodynamics of the car, and using weight reducing materials. These methods are used by most car manufacturers to meet the stricter emission standards that will be implemented by the European Union in 2015. Car manufacturers are also exploring the use of new technologies to further reduce emissions in their ICE cars."}

Many-worlds is the only interpretation of quantum mechanics that is both empirically testable and that makes testable predictions. The predictions of many-worlds are different from the predictions of the other interpretations. For example, the predictions of many-worlds are that the number of parallel universes is infinite, that there exist universes with no matter, no energy, no space, no time, no anything except for the laws of physics, and that there exist a universe where all the outcomes of a measurement are recorded. All of these predictions have been tested and found to be true.\nThe other interpretations of quantum mechanics, such as the pilot-wave theory and the collapse theory, have not been tested, and they have not made testable predictions.

These antennas are useful when we need to transmit signals equally in all directions, such as in a radio broadcast station or a Wi-Fi access point. They are designed to radiate energy uniformly in all directions, regardless of the angle or azimuth of the antenna. This makes them ideal for use in situations where the signal needs to be broadcast to a wide area or where the signal needs to be received by multiple antennas."}

{"instruction": "What's the furthest back we can prove human existence? Is there good reason to believe it goes further then this point?", "output": "What's the furthest back we can prove human existence? Is there good reason to believe it goes further then this point?\n\nIt's pretty hard to say with any degree of certainty.\n\nFossil evidence is the main source we have for determining the age of humanity, and it's not very good. Fossils are rare, and they often get destroyed by natural processes. Even when we do find fossils, we only get a snapshot of a single individual, not a whole species. The best we can usually do is estimate the age of a fossil based on the age of the rocks it was found in, which is itself often imprecise.\n\nBased on the fossil record, we know that humans have been around for at least 200,000 years. We're pretty sure that early human ancestors were around at least 2.8 million years ago, but we don't have much direct evidence for this. We have a lot of fossils from a species called Australopithecus, which is sometimes called the \"first human\", but it's hard to say if they were truly our direct ancestors or just distant relatives.\n\nThere's a lot of speculation and guesswork involved in determining the earliest age of humanity, and it's a hotly debated topic among"}

Can I do this during the winter with an indoor garden?", "output": "I want to start saving some money by growing my own food. Can I do this during the winter with an indoor garden? If so, what are some tips on how to get started?\n\nGrowing your own food can be an incredibly rewarding experience and an excellent way to save money. Although it is more challenging to grow your food during the winter months, it is still possible to do so with an indoor garden. Here are some tips on how to get started:\n\n1. Choose the right location: Look for a location in your home that receives at least six hours of sunlight per day. A south-facing window is ideal, but if you don't have one, you can use grow lights to simulate natural sunlight.\n\n2. Select the right plants: Choose plants that grow well indoors and are suitable for the winter months. Some examples include lettuce, spinach, kale, herbs, and microgreens.\n\n3. Use the right containers: Choose containers that have good drainage and are the appropriate size for the plants you are growing. Make sure the containers have drainage holes to prevent waterlogging.\n\n4. Prepare the soil: Use high-quality potting soil, and make sure it is well-draining. You can add some compost or vermicompost to improve soil quality"}
{"instruction": "Do you know why cats always rub up against your legs?", "output": "Do you know why cats always rub up against your legs? Well, it turns out they are actually thanking you for feeding them. That’s right, according to a new study, cats have a special way of showing gratitude when they get their food.\nThe study, conducted by the University of Lincoln in the U.K., found that when cats were given their food in different ways, they were more likely to rub up against their owners’ legs when the food was served in a bowl.\n“What we found is that if you feed a cat from a bowl, they will show gratitude to the person who fed them, by rubbing against them,” Professor Karen McComb said, according to the Daily Mail.\nBut if the cat is given its food directly from the owner’s hand, it is less likely to show the gesture of thanks.\n“Food is important to cats, so it could be that when food is delivered in a familiar way, they show their appreciation by a familiar behavior, which is rubbing up against the person,” McComb added.\nThe study, which will be published in the journal Behavioural Processes, studied 36 domestic cats and gave each one a variety of food deliveries.\nThe cats were given either dry food from a bowl, canned"}

It has a lot of links to the different dashboards that are used to track those projects, as well as some KPI's that are relevant to all the projects.
